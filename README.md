## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The CourseScout platform operates as an intelligent web agent system with three core components:

- A **Web Scraping Engine** (Playwright automation for dynamic content extraction)
- A **Visual Analysis Layer** (screenshot capture and visual context processing)
- A **AI Recommendation Engine** (GPT-4 powered course analysis and personalization)
- A **Response Formatting Service** (structured output generation with tabular presentation)

This ensures comprehensive course discovery that combines real-time web data with intelligent AI analysis, from user query to personalized recommendations.
